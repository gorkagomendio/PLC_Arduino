  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the Uno and
  Leonardo, it is attached to digital pin 13. If you're unsure what
  pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the documentation at http://arduino.cc
  This example code is in the public domain.
